# Artificial Intelligence as Music Generater
This project held and the course of Artificial Intelegence in innopolis university May 2022
The Task is: 
You are given several monophonic midi files, which are representing melodies. By using an evolutionary algorithm, you have to generate an accompaniment for each of those melodies. You are
allowed to use any type of EA, however, you are obliged to use both crossover and mutation for evolving accompaniment. Accompaniment should be represented by a sequence of chords. Each chord
should contain exactly three notes. For simplicity you have to consider only the next types of chords: 
1. major and minor triads

2. first and second inversions of major and minor triads

3. diminished chords (DIM)

4. suspended second chords (SUS2)

5. suspended fourth chords (SUS4)
